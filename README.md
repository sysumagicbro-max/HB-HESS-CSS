# Shenzhen Battery Swapping Station Capacity Survey Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains survey data regarding the battery inventory capacity of **69 operating battery swapping stations** in Shenzhen, China. 

The dataset was collected on **February 2, 2026**, to investigate the real-world infrastructure scale and to validate the representativeness of simulation parameters used in our research on **Heterogeneous-Battery Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HB-HESS)**.

## Key Statistics
- **Survey Scope:** 69 Stations across major urban districts in Shenzhen (e.g., Nanshan, Futian).
- **Total Battery Inventory:** 753 Units.
- **Average Capacity:** **10.91 Batteries per Station**.

## Data Description
The dataset is provided in the `data/` directory (e.g., `shenzhen_bss_survey.csv`).
